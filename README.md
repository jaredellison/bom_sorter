# BOM_sorter

An electronics bill of materials contains values like 10k, 1uF and
1pf. The abreviated orders of magnitude make it easier to think about
an enormous range of values but it is not easy to sort a spreadsheet 
by part values.

This script takes a csv file exported from the Electronics CAD program
Diptrace, finds the values field and sorts the component values from 
least to greatest to make organizing parts and assembling circuit boards
based on the BOM easier.
